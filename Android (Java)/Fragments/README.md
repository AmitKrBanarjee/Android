Android Fragment is the part of activity, it is also known as sub-activity. There can be more than one fragment in an activity. Fragments represent multiple screen inside one activity.

Android fragment lifecycle is affected by activity lifecycle because fragments are included in activity.

Each fragment has its own life cycle methods that is affected by activity life cycle because fragments are embedded in activity.

The FragmentManager class is responsible to make interaction between fragment objects.

My Example codes in this section are as follows:

1. **FragmentExOne** - splits activity in three fragments.

  <div aligncenter>
  ![Alt text](FragmentExOne.PNG?raw=true "FragmentExOne")
  </div>
